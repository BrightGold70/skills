### While Writing:
1. Use formal, objective language
2. Support all claims with citations
3. Maintain logical flow between paragraphs
4. Use clear topic sentences
5. Include transitions
6. Define technical terms
7. Number figures and tables consecutively

### After Drafting:
1. Revise for clarity and concision
2. Check all citations match references
3. Verify IEEE format compliance
4. Proofread for grammar and spelling
5. Have colleagues review
6. Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
