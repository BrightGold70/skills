# Developer Growth Analysis

This skill analyzes your coding work to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement.

## When to Use This Skill

- Understand development patterns and habits from recent work
- Identify specific technical gaps or recurring challenges
- Discover which topics would benefit from deeper study
- Get curated learning resources tailored to actual work
- Track improvement areas across projects
- Get high-quality articles that address developing skills

## What This Skill Does

1. **Reads Chat History**: Access local chat history (e.g., from Claude Code, OpenCode)
2. **Identifies Development Patterns**: Analyzes problems solved, technologies used, challenges encountered
3. **Detects Improvement Areas**: Recognizes skill gaps, repeated struggles, inefficient approaches
4. **Generates Personalized Report**: Creates comprehensive report with recommendations
5. **Finds Learning Resources**: Curates articles relevant to improvement areas

## How to Use

Ask to analyze your recent coding work:

```
Analyze my developer growth from my recent chats
Analyze my work from today and suggest areas for improvement
```

## Report Structure

```markdown
# Your Developer Growth Report

[2-3 paragraphs summarizing what you worked on]

## Improvement Areas (Prioritized)

### 1. [Area Name]
**Why This Matters**: [Explanation]
**What I Observed**: [Specific evidence]
**Recommendation**: [Concrete steps to improve]

## Strengths Observed
[2-3 bullet points highlighting things you're doing well]

## Action Items
Priority order:
1. [Action item from highest priority area]
2. [Next action item]

## Learning Resources
[Curated articles for each improvement area]
```

## Instructions

1. **Access Chat History**: Read from relevant history files (OpenCode sessions, Claude history)
2. **Analyze Work Patterns**:
   - Projects and domains worked on
   - Technologies used
   - Problem types solved
   - Challenges encountered
3. **Identify Improvement Areas** (3-5 specific areas):
   - Specific and evidence-based
   - Actionable and prioritized
4. **Generate Report**: Follow the structure above
5. **Find Resources**: Search for relevant learning materials

## For OpenCode

- Chat history may be in `~/.config/opencode/` or session files
- Check for conversation history in project or global config
