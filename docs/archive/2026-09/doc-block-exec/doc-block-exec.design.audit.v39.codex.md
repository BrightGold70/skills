## Summary

Axis C reconciliation is below; every listed AC is implemented-as-written except AC-3.10, which is absent for an existing FIFO with no reader. The reservation path can block before it emits any verdict or reaches the subprocess timeout, so this is a hard FR-3/FR-5 and signal-discipline gap.

## Must-fix

- AC-3.10 is absent for a blocking stream endpoint — the spec requires that “a `--stdout`/`--stderr` path that cannot be written refuses” before the block runs, while the design opens an existing path with blocking `os.open(path, O_WRONLY | O_APPEND)` and expressly permits the resolved target. An existing FIFO with no reader makes that open block indefinitely: no `StreamPathUnwritable`, no `DOCBLOCK:` token, and no subprocess timeout. Define a non-blocking/regular-file reservation policy (including the descriptor validation needed to avoid a check-to-open race) and add a no-reader-FIFO test that observes a bounded `stream_path_unwritable` refusal before any block side effect.
