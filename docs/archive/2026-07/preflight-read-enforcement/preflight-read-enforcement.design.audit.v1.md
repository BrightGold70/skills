## Summary
The design cleanly implements the preflight enforcement spec without requiring any new components, anchoring the receipt path to the pin file to get test isolation for free. All functional requirements and acceptance criteria from the spec are implemented as written, with no narrowing or divergence. No invariant violations were found.

## Nit
- `preflight.receipt` in `.gitignore` — The design mentions the receipt path is gitignored/untracked (AC-8.4), but does not list `.gitignore` as a modified file. If `.h-mad/` is already globally ignored for the repo, this happens automatically; if only specific files are ignored, a `.gitignore` update may be needed.
