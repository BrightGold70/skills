# Skill Monitoring — bugs & improvement points (standing)

Live registry of known bugs and improvement points in the `h-mad` / `handoff` skills, surfaced during real `/h-mad` runs. **Not auto-fixed** — each entry is under monitoring until deliberately actioned. Action a batch as its own `/h-mad` feature when priority warrants.

**Status:** 🔴 bug (correctness) · 🟡 process/robustness · 🟢 improvement/opt
**Lifecycle:** `MONITORING` (tracked, unfixed) · `PLANNED` (scheduled) · `FIXED` (link commit) · `WONTFIX` (with reason)

Origin run: `orca-git-native-checkpoints-and-merge-gate` (shipped main `2b95476`, 2026-07-22).
**All F1–F13 resolved on `feature/186-skill-monitoring-fixes` (2026-07-22)** — h-mad suite 355/0 with session pins present. Fixes below; each entry's Status flipped to FIXED.

| ID | Sev | Status | One-line |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | 🔴 | FIXED | audit gate false-passes on agy/Gemini-TUI output (indent + `•` bullets) — gate now dedents + accepts `-`/`*`/`•` |
| F2 | 🔴 | FIXED | empty extract output false-passes the gate — `GATE: INVALID` + exit 2 when Must-fix/Should-fix headers absent |
| F3 | 🟡 | FIXED | `tui-idle` unreliable for Gemini — documented: poll for `<sentinel>-END` (agent-substrate.md) |
| F4 | 🟡 | FIXED | no safe nudge — added `hmad-dispatch interrupt` (Ctrl-C) + freeze-capture recipe |
| F5 | 🟡 | FIXED | scrollback < report — added `read --cursor N` / `--from-start` full-buffer read |
| F6 | 🟡 | FIXED | agy homebrew self-upgrade — documented version/trust preflight |
| F7 | 🟢 | FIXED | default substrate was cmux when both present → flipped to orca (`9cdd455`) |
| F8 | 🟡 | FIXED | jsonschema missing — actionable remedy message (interpreter/venv/pip) in `h_mad_state_validate.py` |
| F9 | 🟡 | FIXED | Codex Orca title = worktree name — pin `HMAD_ORCA_CODEX_TERMINAL` (documented in agent-substrate.md identity) |
| F10 | 🟡 | FIXED | `~/.claude/skills/handoff` was a real dir → symlinked to repo 2026-07-22 |
| F11 | 🔴 | FIXED | verbs swallow `ok:false` — shared `_orca_json` guard (`.ok != false`) on all extract verbs |
| F12 | 🔴 | FIXED | `autonomous_entry_ts` schema — now `["string","integer","null"]`, epoch int validates |
| F13 | 🔴 | FIXED | dispatch-test `run()` leaks pins — now strips every `HMAD_ORCA_*` |

## h-mad audit pipeline (scripts)

- 🔴 **F1 — audit gate false-passes on agy/Gemini-TUI output.** `h_mad_audit_gate.py` requires `## Must-fix` at column 0 and counts only `- ` bullets. agy (Antigravity/Gemini) emits every line indented ~2 spaces and uses `•` bullets, so a real Must-fix scored `GATE: PASS must=0 should=0` (plan audit cycle 1). **Fix:** dedent + normalize `•`→`-` at the source — in `h_mad_extract_report.py` (extraction) so the written audit file is already clean, and/or make the gate tolerant of leading whitespace + `•`. See [[feedback_hmad_agy_gemini_tui_capture]] and prior `feedback_finalizer_hang_guard` (`•` known since 2026-06).
- 🔴 **F2 — empty extract output false-passes the gate.** `h_mad_extract_report.py` exits 2 and writes nothing when the sentinel pair is absent; piping that empty file into `h_mad_audit_gate.py` yields `GATE: PASS must=0`. An empty audit must be un-gateable. **Fix:** gate should error (exit 2 / `GATE: INVALID`) on input lacking the schema's `## Must-fix`/`## Should-fix` headers, so "no report" can never read as "clean report". Orchestrator must treat extractor exit-2 as no-verdict (never gate).
- 🟡 **F3 — `orca terminal wait --for tui-idle` is unreliable for Gemini.** Fooled by the spinner: reports `satisfied:false` with stale `blockedReason: codex-trust-workspace` when done, or idle mid-generation. `hmad-dispatch wait` inherits this. **Lesson/opt:** for the Orca+agy path, poll the tail for the `<sentinel>-END` line as the completion signal instead of trusting tui-idle.

## hmad-dispatch (agy/Orca capture)

- 🔴 **F4 — no safe "flush/nudge" for a done-but-unrendered agy REPL.** A bare Enter (`--enter`) submits a BLANK turn to Antigravity and starts junk generation. There is no `hmad-dispatch` verb to reliably force a final render or to interrupt. **Lesson:** Ctrl-C (`$'\x03'`) exits the agy REPL to the shell and FREEZES scrollback → clean `orca terminal read --limit 200` capture; then re-seed agy. Consider a `hmad-dispatch interrupt <agent>` verb + a documented capture-via-freeze recipe.
- 🟡 **F5 — retained scrollback < report length + per-frame redraw fragments sentinels.** Live `orca terminal read` tail can miss a clean BEGIN…END pair mid-generation. Mitigated by the freeze-capture in F4. **Opt:** `hmad-dispatch read` could grow a `--cursor 0 --all` full-buffer mode.
- 🟡 **F6 — agy self-upgraded via homebrew mid-run** (1.1.1→1.1.5), dropping to welcome + trust-workspace prompt and interrupting the dispatch. **Lesson:** pin/preflight the agy version, or re-confirm trust before each dispatch block.

## Environment / bootstrap

- 🟢 **F7 — default substrate was cmux when both binaries present.** `FIXED` — FR-2 of the origin feature flipped the default to orca (`9cdd455`). Kept here for provenance.
- 🟡 **F8 — `python3` (homebrew 3.14) lacks `jsonschema`; state writer errors `ERROR: jsonschema is required`.** PEP-668 blocks `pip install`. Worked around with `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3` (jsonschema 4.25.1 + pytest 8.3.5). **Fix:** h-mad state scripts need a documented interpreter/venv, or a graceful degrade + install hint when jsonschema is absent.
- 🟡 **F9 — Codex Orca terminal title is the worktree name** (`skills`), so `_orca_find codex` can't title-match; must pin `HMAD_ORCA_CODEX_TERMINAL`. (Already known: `project_orca_adaptation_backlog`; re-confirmed live.)

## handoff

- 🟡 **F10 — `~/.claude/skills/handoff` was a real dir, NOT a symlink to the repo** (unlike `h-mad`). `FIXED` 2026-07-22: replaced with a symlink → `/Users/kimhawk/orca/skills/handoff` (pre-install backup at `~/.claude/handoff-preinstall-backup-2026-07-22`). Repo changes are now live in the installed skill.

## h-mad verbs / state / tests

- 🔴 **F11 — existing worktree/file verbs swallow `ok:false`.** `_cmd_worktree_ps`, `_cmd_worktree_create`, `_cmd_file_diff`, `_cmd_file_open_changed`, `_cmd_task_create`, `_cmd_gate_create` all pipe `orca … --json | _json_extract '…'`. With `set -o pipefail` a non-zero orca *exit* propagates, but an exit-0 `"ok":false` error envelope passes silently as empty/garbage. The NEW `worktree-comment`/`worktree-current` verbs capture-then-check `.ok`; the existing verbs still have the latent bug. **Fix:** give all `orca`-calling verbs the capture-then-`jq -e '.ok==true'` guard (or a shared `_orca_json` helper — single-source per base invariant).
- 🔴 **F12 — `autonomous_entry_ts` can't hold the value the SKILL writes.** Phase-5a spec: write `phase="step5"` + `autonomous_entry_ts=<now>`. But `h_mad_state_write.py` refuses any non-null `autonomous_entry_ts` (`classified historical`) — the strict schema evidently types it null-only. Result: `phase=step5` writes fine, the timestamp stays `null`, and `status`'s stale-`step5` heuristic (`autonomous_entry_ts > 60min ago`) can never fire. **Fix:** make the schema field `["integer","null"]` so the prescribed write validates.
- 🔴 **F13 — dispatch-test `run()` helper leaks live `HMAD_ORCA_*` pins.** `test_hmad_dispatch.py::run()` strips `CMUX`/`CMUX_PANE`/`ORCA_SESSION`/`ORCA_TERMINAL_ID`/`HMAD_SUBSTRATE`, but NOT `HMAD_ORCA_COORDINATOR_TERMINAL` / `HMAD_ORCA_CODEX_TERMINAL` / `HMAD_ORCA_AGY_TERMINAL`. Running the suite from inside a live h-mad Orca session (exactly when Phase-5/6 runs it) leaks those pins and 8 `orca_identity`/`task`/`await` tests fail spuriously. Verified: they pass with pins stripped (`env -u …`). **Fix:** add the three `HMAD_ORCA_*_TERMINAL` pins (and any `HMAD_ORCA_*`) to the pop-list in `run()`.

## Surfaced by the F1–F13 fix review (subagent code-review, 2026-07-22)

- 🟡 **F14 — audit gate only counted bullet-prefixed findings; prose/numbered/blockquote findings scored PASS.** `FIXED` 2026-07-22. `classify()` now decides per section on the line *payload* (bullet remainder, else the line itself): a section is clean ONLY if every payload is the `None` sentinel; otherwise it has findings — counted as the number of `-`/`*`/`•` bullets, or 1 when the content is non-`None` but bullet-less (prose / `1.` numbered / `> blockquote` / stray note). A wrapped multi-line bullet still counts once (continuation lines aren't bullets, so they don't add). This is fail-safe: an off-template finding now FAILs the gate (human reformats) instead of silently passing. Trade-off: an off-template *reassurance* note under a section also FAILs — reviewers must write `None` for a clean section, per the template contract. Supersedes the earlier bullet-space-only handling of markdown emphasis.

## Handoff/merge-gate Orca-wiring audit (2026-07-22, post-ship review)

Found by auditing the shipped handoff + merge-gate against the **real** Orca payload/CLI (the reconcile was verified by mocked unit tests + doc review, never run live — [[feedback_tracer_bullet_before_ceremony]]). All FIXED on `feature/187-orca-reconcile-and-gate-fixes`.

| ID | Sev | Status | One-line |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | 🔴 | FIXED | handoff READ read wrong JSON path — payload is `{"worktree":{…}}`, prose said `.branch`/`.comment` → now `.worktree.branch` etc. |
| G2 | 🔴 | FIXED | branch-format mismatch — `worktree-current` returns `refs/heads/main`, doc uses `main` → prose now strips `refs/heads/` before compare |
| G3 | 🟡 | FIXED | `worktree-ps` shape `{"worktrees":[…],"truncated"}` + truncation now documented (iterate `.worktrees[]`, surface `truncated`, `--limit`) |
| G4 | 🟡 | FIXED | merge-gate blocking path had no wait mechanism — added `hmad-dispatch gate-wait <id>` (polls `gate-list`); orchestration-mode blocking paths now use it, not `await` |
| G5 | 🟡 | FIXED | orchestration needed a manual coordinator pin — `_coordinator()` now auto-detects from `ORCA_PANE_KEY` leafId → `terminal list`; `orchestration: on` with no setup |
| G6 | 🟢 | FIXED | WRITE stamp clobbered a foreign worktree comment — prose now reads `.worktree.comment` first and appends to a non-skill note instead of overwriting |

- 🔴 **G1** — `worktree-current` payload is `{"worktree":{branch,path,comment,…}}`; the handoff READ reconcile read `.branch`/`.path`/`.comment` (one level too shallow). Fixed to `.worktree.*`. Live-confirmed shape.
- 🔴 **G2** — `.worktree.branch` is a full ref (`refs/heads/main`); the handoff doc's Branch field + `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref` use the short name → naive compare = permanent phantom divergence. Prose now strips `refs/heads/`.
- 🟡 **G3** — `worktree-ps` returns `{"worktrees":[…],"totalCount","truncated"}`; prose now iterates `.worktrees[]`, strips `refs/heads/`, and surfaces `truncated` (cap raised via `--limit`).
- 🟡 **G4** — only `gate-create`/`gate-resolve` existed; a "blocking" gate could be opened but not waited on (`await` waits for `worker_done`, not gates). Added `gate-wait <id> [--timeout][--interval]` polling `orchestration gate-list`. **Fails closed** (review hardening): resolves only on `.resolution` present OR `.status == "resolved"` — any other status (`open`/`created`/`waiting`/`pending`) keeps polling, so a blocking merge gate never proceeds on an ambiguous state (worst case = spurious timeout, the correct bias). Live-verified clean timeout; `test_gate_wait_fails_closed_on_non_resolved_status` locks it. **Resolved-gate shape now confirmed against a live runtime** (2026-07-22): a full lifecycle — `task-create → gate-create → gate-resolve → gate-wait` — showed pending = `{status:"pending", resolution:null, resolved_at:null}` and resolved = `{status:"resolved", resolution:"yes", resolved_at:"…"}`, and `gate-wait` returned `yes`. The fail-closed jq (`.resolution` present OR `.status=="resolved"`) matches the real field names exactly. No caveat remains.
- 🟡 **G5** — `_coordinator()` auto-detects from `ORCA_PANE_KEY="<tabId>:<leafId>"` → matches a terminal's `.leafId` in `terminal list`. Live-verified: `orchestration: on` with no `HMAD_ORCA_COORDINATOR_TERMINAL`. Pin still overrides.
- 🟢 **G6** — WRITE stamp now reads the current comment first; a foreign (non-`handoff:`/`h-mad`) note is appended to, not clobbered.

## Architecture: report-file transport (root fix for the scrape-fragility class)

- 🟢 **A1 — audit/TDD verdict collection moved from TUI-scrape to file-drop under Orca.** `FIXED` 2026-07-22 (feature/188). New `hmad-dispatch report-wait <path>` verb: the dispatched agent writes its full report to `<path>` and creates `<path>.done`; the coordinator polls the marker and reads the file — no `tui-idle` guess, no screen scrape, no `BEGIN/END` sentinel, no dedent/`•`-normalize. Substrate-agnostic (shared fs; scrape stays the cmux/unpinned fallback). The audit-prompt + codex-implementer templates carry a `<REPORT_FILE_PATH>` contract slot; SKILL §Audit-assembly + orchestration-mode.md document report-file as the default under Orca. **Live e2e verified**: agy wrote clean markdown to the file + `.done`, `report-wait` read it, and `h_mad_audit_gate.py` scored `GATE: PASS` directly with zero normalization. This addresses the *root cause* of F1–F6 (all were TUI-scrape fragility): on the report-file path those failure modes cannot arise. F1's gate tolerance + F3/F4/F5 scrape guards remain as the fallback-path hardening.
