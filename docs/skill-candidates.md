# Skill Candidates

Appended by the `/handoff` automation scout, newest session last. **Status is only useful if it is
current** — reconcile a row when the thing it describes ships, the same way `docs/skill-monitoring.md`
rows are flipped.

**Verdicts:** `yes` / `maybe` / `no` (scout's initial call) · `LANDED` (shipped — name where) ·
`SUPERSEDED` (a different fix removed the need) · `DECLINED` (deliberately not doing it, with the
reason) · `done` (legacy spelling of LANDED).

## Open, highest recurrence first (2026-07-23)

| rec | candidate | session |
|---|---|---|
| 12+ | `agy/codex poll-until-idle dispatch` | 2026-07-20 orca-adaptation-tiers |
| 9 | `close-a-filed-defect cycle` | 2026-07-23 monitoring-registry-drained |
| 9 | `H-MAD phase-doc + agy-audit-gate loop` *(maybe)* | 2026-07-20 orca-adaptation-tiers |
| 6 | `audit→fix→subagent-review→merge loop` *(maybe)* | 2026-07-22 orca-skills-hardening |
| 3 | `test-pinned-the-defect check` | 2026-07-23 monitoring-registry-drained |
| 2 | `orca-verb-live-reconcile`, `live-e2e verb sweep`, `both-halves doc fix` *(maybe)* | various |
| 1 | `differential-validator-test` *(maybe)* | 2026-07-23 monitoring-registry-drained |

The top two are the **same rhythm at two altitudes** — poll-until-idle is the dispatch primitive,
close-a-filed-defect is the loop built on it — and together they account for most of the tool calls
in a working session. Promote those before anything lower on the list.

The three `maybe` rows marked *"already the /h-mad skill"* are not really candidates: they describe
the skill that exists. They are kept as provenance for why a helper was or was not built, not as
work.


## 2026-07-20 — orca-adaptation-tiers

- **agy/codex poll-until-idle dispatch**: assemble prompt -> hmad-dispatch send -> background poll on idle marker ("? for shortcuts" present, "esc to cancel" absent) + schema token -> parse verdict — recurrence: 12+ (every audit/TDD/arch-review this session) — candidate: yes
- **H-MAD phase-doc + agy-audit-gate loop**: write phase doc -> assemble audit prompt (template+doc+invariants) -> dispatch agy -> gate -> fix -> re-audit — recurrence: 9 (3 features x 3 phases) — candidate: maybe (already the /h-mad skill; a helper to stage+dispatch+gate in one call would cut ~40 tool calls)

## 2026-07-21 — orca-arc-complete-hemasuite-wiring

- **orca-verb-live-reconcile**: after shipping an orca-wrapping verb, run a live create→list→remove cycle against the real runtime and fix output-key extraction — recurrence: 2 (worktree-create + automation-create both had the envelope-.id bug) — candidate: maybe
- **hmad-full-cycle-driver**: the repeated author-docs→agy-audit(2cyc)→Codex-TDD→verify→agy-5e→6a-prime→ship sequence ran 4× this session — recurrence: 4 — candidate: no (already the /h-mad skill)

## 2026-07-22 — h-mad-fourteen-issues-shipped

- **file-issue-then-fix-under-TDD**: file a GitHub issue capturing the measurement, then fix it RED→GREEN with a test file per issue, closing via a `Closes #N` trailer. Ran 14 times this session with an identical shape. — recurrence: 14 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `h_mad_issue_fix_gate.py` + SKILL.md protocol
- **verify-the-mutation-not-the-command**: after any git/shell mutation, re-read the resulting state rather than trusting exit codes. Caught two silent zsh no-ops (backtick execution in `-m`, leading-dash paths) that both looked like success. — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `invariants.base.md` §Mutation verification
- **replay-the-incident-against-the-fix**: validate a protocol fix by running it against the historical data that motivated it, not only unit stubs. Caught a wrong commit-count heuristic that unit tests passed. — recurrence: 4 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `invariants.base.md` §Incident replay (merged with `replay-detector-against-history`, recurrence 3)
- **worktree-for-live-skill-edits**: when editing a skill whose working tree is symlinked as the live `~/.claude/skills/<name>`, work in a git worktree so an in-flight run keeps reading the merged tree. — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Editing this skill while a run is in flight
- **sanitize-before-public-filing**: grep issue bodies against a forbidden-term list (project names, slugs, local paths, private symbols) before filing to a public tracker. — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Filing to a public tracker

## 2026-07-22 — orca-skills-hardening

- **audit→fix→subagent-review→merge loop**: repeated 6× this session (F/G/188/189 + 2), each catching a real bug — recurrence: 6 — candidate: maybe (this IS the /h-mad + review discipline; already a skill)
- **live-e2e verb sweep against real orca**: exercise every hmad-dispatch verb + skill mechanism vs the live runtime, matrix report — recurrence: 2 — candidate: maybe

## 2026-07-22 — orca-agent-resolution-hardening

- **h-mad audit-prompt assembler**: hand-wrote assemble_audit/design/implplan.py in scratchpad 3× this session to splice INLINE_* slots into audit-prompt.template.md — a bundled `scripts/h_mad_assemble_audit.py <phase>` would DRY it into the skill — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** 2026-07-22 (`3f8ae83`) — `h-mad/scripts/h_mad_assemble_audit.py`. Duplicate of the `done` row in the next session block; kept for provenance.
- **launch+pin agent bootstrap**: `hmad-dispatch launch/pin` then verify resolve — recurrence: 2 — candidate: no (already a verb)

## 2026-07-22 — audit-assembler-agent-resolution

- **h-mad audit-prompt assembler**: SHIPPED this session as `h-mad/scripts/h_mad_assemble_audit.py` — closes the 2026-07-22 orca-agent-resolution-hardening candidate (recurrence was 3) — recurrence: 4 — candidate: done
- **staged-prompt repair sweep**: script that rewrites every `/tmp/audit_*.txt` to what the current template would emit (strip note, resolve markers, de-dupe rubrics), with backups + a freshness guard skipping in-flight prompts — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **DECLINED** (Wave 4b, 2026-07-23). Every staged prompt on disk belongs to one feature that shipped 2026-07-22; `/tmp` is scratch, and `h_mad_assemble_audit.py` regenerates any prompt in a single call. A sweep would carry backup and in-flight-freshness logic to repair files nothing will read again. Revisit only if a live run is ever blocked by a stale staged prompt.
- **throwaway stub-harness probe**: import `tests/test_hmad_dispatch.py` helpers into a scratch pytest to empirically confirm a suspected resolver hole *before* fixing it, then delete — turned two hypotheses into verified bugs and killed a third — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED as a practice** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Confirming a suspected defect before fixing it. Deliberately NOT scripted: the artifact is meant to be thrown away, so a permanent script would contradict the thing being taught. Recurrence bumped to 3 — it is what turned J17 from a rejected selector into the guard bypass.

## 2026-07-23 — wave2-preflight-shipped

- **discriminating-regression-test**: before keeping a regression test, revert the fix and confirm it fails — a test that passes against the code it was written to catch is decoration — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4c) — `invariants.base.md` §Test discrimination (merged with `mutation-test-every-guard`)
- **label-guards-in-red-dispatch**: state expected fail/pass counts and mark regression guards explicitly when a TDD task is refactor-shaped; "every test must FAIL" makes the implementer manufacture failures — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4c) — `codex-implementer-prompt.md` §Your Job + SKILL.md 5d (the old blanket "Verify all tests FAIL" halt was itself the harmful instruction)
- **verify-review-premise-before-acting**: check a review finding's stated premise against source before applying its prescription; 2 of 5 findings this session were right in substance and wrong in direction — recurrence: 4 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4c) — SKILL.md §Verifying a review finding before acting on it
- **content-probe-agent-pane**: identify an Orca agent pane by its launch banner via `terminal read --cursor 0`, never by title — recurrence: 5 — candidate: **SUPERSEDED** by J16 (main `bf9c4c3`). `_orca_find` Pass 0 joins `worktree ps` `agents[].paneKey` to `terminal list` `tabId:leafId`, which is exact where content-probing is heuristic — and content-probing itself *failed* on 2026-07-23 when both panes had reset buffers. Order is now paneKey → content → never title.

## 2026-07-23 — wave3-wave4a-shipped

- **mutation-test-every-guard**: after implementing a guard, stub it to its permissive value and re-run the suite; zero failures means the guard is unenforced, not that it is safe — caught 2 vacuous guards this session that review and a green run both missed — recurrence: 7 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4c) — `invariants.base.md` §Test discrimination
- **replay-detector-against-history**: validate a new detector/heuristic against the real artifacts already on disk, not only synthetic cases — 14 handcrafted cases passed while the real label `Working-tree concern:` was rejected — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — merged into `invariants.base.md` §Incident replay
- **panekey-join-agent-identity**: resolve an Orca agent handle by joining `worktree ps` `agents[].paneKey` to `terminal list` `tabId:leafId`, rather than title or preview or content — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED** (J16, main `bf9c4c3`) — `_orca_find` Pass 0; closed orca#9870
- **tracer-bullet-design-assumptions**: run each load-bearing design assumption as a throwaway shell/git command before writing it into the design — confirmed the `--porcelain` boundary and the base-ref chain, and found a truncation hole, all before any code existed — recurrence: 4 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4c) — `invariants.base.md` §Assumption verification
- **assert-literal-instruction-in-doc-tests**: anchor documentation tests on the literal instruction string; asserting that two component words appear "somewhere" passes with the guidance deleted — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED implicitly** (Waves 4b+4c) — every doc test added in both waves asserts the literal sentence against a whitespace-normalised copy, and each was mutation-tested. Covered by `invariants.base.md` §Test discrimination; no separate rule needed.

## 2026-07-23 — monitoring-registry-drained

- **close-a-filed-defect cycle**: read entry → verify its stated premise against source → reproduce
  live → TDD the fix → mutation-test every guard → dogfood live → flip the registry row with
  evidence. Ran 9× this session (J1–J5, J11–J13, J17) with an identical shape, and the
  premise-check step changed the fix in 4 of them — recurrence: 9 — candidate: yes
- **test-pinned-the-defect check**: when a fix breaks an existing test, first ask whether the test
  asserted the bug as an acceptance criterion rather than adjusting the fix — J17's forwarded
  selector, J1's create-response handle, J2's AC-6.5 pin path — recurrence: 3 — candidate: yes
- **snapshot-live-state-before-mutation-testing**: mutating a path-resolution branch redirects the
  suite onto real files; snapshot the target (or sandbox the cwd) first — recurrence: 1 —
  candidate: **LANDED** (J18) — `h-mad/tests/conftest.py::_protect_live_pin_file` snapshots and
  restores the live pin file and fails loudly; `invariants.base.md` §"Test discrimination" carries
  the caveat.
- **differential-validator-test**: when replacing a library with a bundled implementation, assert
  verdict-equality against the library across a construct-complete corpus AND the real artifacts on
  disk, rather than testing the replacement alone — recurrence: 1 — candidate: maybe
- **both-halves doc fix**: when deleting an unexecutable instruction, assert in the same test that
  the executable replacement landed — a "is it gone" assertion passes for a deletion that lost the
  capability (J11) — recurrence: 2 — candidate: maybe
