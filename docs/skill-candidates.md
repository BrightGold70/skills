# Skill Candidates

## 2026-07-20 — orca-adaptation-tiers

- **agy/codex poll-until-idle dispatch**: assemble prompt -> hmad-dispatch send -> background poll on idle marker ("? for shortcuts" present, "esc to cancel" absent) + schema token -> parse verdict — recurrence: 12+ (every audit/TDD/arch-review this session) — candidate: yes
- **H-MAD phase-doc + agy-audit-gate loop**: write phase doc -> assemble audit prompt (template+doc+invariants) -> dispatch agy -> gate -> fix -> re-audit — recurrence: 9 (3 features x 3 phases) — candidate: maybe (already the /h-mad skill; a helper to stage+dispatch+gate in one call would cut ~40 tool calls)

## 2026-07-21 — orca-arc-complete-hemasuite-wiring

- **orca-verb-live-reconcile**: after shipping an orca-wrapping verb, run a live create→list→remove cycle against the real runtime and fix output-key extraction — recurrence: 2 (worktree-create + automation-create both had the envelope-.id bug) — candidate: maybe
- **hmad-full-cycle-driver**: the repeated author-docs→agy-audit(2cyc)→Codex-TDD→verify→agy-5e→6a-prime→ship sequence ran 4× this session — recurrence: 4 — candidate: no (already the /h-mad skill)

## 2026-07-22 — h-mad-fourteen-issues-shipped

- **file-issue-then-fix-under-TDD**: file a GitHub issue capturing the measurement, then fix it RED→GREEN with a test file per issue, closing via a `Closes #N` trailer. Ran 14 times this session with an identical shape. — recurrence: 14 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `h_mad_issue_fix_gate.py` + SKILL.md protocol
- **verify-the-mutation-not-the-command**: after any git/shell mutation, re-read the resulting state rather than trusting exit codes. Caught two silent zsh no-ops (backtick execution in `-m`, leading-dash paths) that both looked like success. — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `invariants.base.md` §Mutation verification
- **replay-the-incident-against-the-fix**: validate a protocol fix by running it against the historical data that motivated it, not only unit stubs. Caught a wrong commit-count heuristic that unit tests passed. — recurrence: 4 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — `invariants.base.md` §Incident replay (merged with `replay-detector-against-history`, recurrence 3)
- **worktree-for-live-skill-edits**: when editing a skill whose working tree is symlinked as the live `~/.claude/skills/<name>`, work in a git worktree so an in-flight run keeps reading the merged tree. — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Editing this skill while a run is in flight
- **sanitize-before-public-filing**: grep issue bodies against a forbidden-term list (project names, slugs, local paths, private symbols) before filing to a public tracker. — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **LANDED** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Filing to a public tracker

## 2026-07-22 — orca-skills-hardening

- **audit→fix→subagent-review→merge loop**: repeated 6× this session (F/G/188/189 + 2), each catching a real bug — recurrence: 6 — candidate: maybe (this IS the /h-mad + review discipline; already a skill)
- **live-e2e verb sweep against real orca**: exercise every hmad-dispatch verb + skill mechanism vs the live runtime, matrix report — recurrence: 2 — candidate: maybe

## 2026-07-22 — orca-agent-resolution-hardening

- **h-mad audit-prompt assembler**: hand-wrote assemble_audit/design/implplan.py in scratchpad 3× this session to splice INLINE_* slots into audit-prompt.template.md — a bundled `scripts/h_mad_assemble_audit.py <phase>` would DRY it into the skill — recurrence: 3 — candidate: maybe
- **launch+pin agent bootstrap**: `hmad-dispatch launch/pin` then verify resolve — recurrence: 2 — candidate: no (already a verb)

## 2026-07-22 — audit-assembler-agent-resolution

- **h-mad audit-prompt assembler**: SHIPPED this session as `h-mad/scripts/h_mad_assemble_audit.py` — closes the 2026-07-22 orca-agent-resolution-hardening candidate (recurrence was 3) — recurrence: 4 — candidate: done
- **staged-prompt repair sweep**: script that rewrites every `/tmp/audit_*.txt` to what the current template would emit (strip note, resolve markers, de-dupe rubrics), with backups + a freshness guard skipping in-flight prompts — recurrence: 2 — candidate: **DECLINED** (Wave 4b, 2026-07-23). Every staged prompt on disk belongs to one feature that shipped 2026-07-22; `/tmp` is scratch, and `h_mad_assemble_audit.py` regenerates any prompt in a single call. A sweep would carry backup and in-flight-freshness logic to repair files nothing will read again. Revisit only if a live run is ever blocked by a stale staged prompt.
- **throwaway stub-harness probe**: import `tests/test_hmad_dispatch.py` helpers into a scratch pytest to empirically confirm a suspected resolver hole *before* fixing it, then delete — turned two hypotheses into verified bugs and killed a third — recurrence: 3 — candidate: **LANDED as a practice** (Wave 4b) — SKILL.md §Confirming a suspected defect before fixing it. Deliberately NOT scripted: the artifact is meant to be thrown away, so a permanent script would contradict the thing being taught. Recurrence bumped to 3 — it is what turned J17 from a rejected selector into the guard bypass.

## 2026-07-23 — wave2-preflight-shipped

- **discriminating-regression-test**: before keeping a regression test, revert the fix and confirm it fails — a test that passes against the code it was written to catch is decoration — recurrence: 3 — candidate: yes
- **label-guards-in-red-dispatch**: state expected fail/pass counts and mark regression guards explicitly when a TDD task is refactor-shaped; "every test must FAIL" makes the implementer manufacture failures — recurrence: 3 — candidate: yes
- **verify-review-premise-before-acting**: check a review finding's stated premise against source before applying its prescription; 2 of 5 findings this session were right in substance and wrong in direction — recurrence: 4 — candidate: yes
- **content-probe-agent-pane**: identify an Orca agent pane by its launch banner via `terminal read --cursor 0`, never by title — recurrence: 5 — candidate: yes (largely covered by hmad-dispatch pin/launch)

## 2026-07-23 — wave3-wave4a-shipped

- **mutation-test-every-guard**: after implementing a guard, stub it to its permissive value and re-run the suite; zero failures means the guard is unenforced, not that it is safe — caught 2 vacuous guards this session that review and a green run both missed — recurrence: 7 — candidate: yes
- **replay-detector-against-history**: validate a new detector/heuristic against the real artifacts already on disk, not only synthetic cases — 14 handcrafted cases passed while the real label `Working-tree concern:` was rejected — recurrence: 3 — candidate: yes
- **panekey-join-agent-identity**: resolve an Orca agent handle by joining `worktree ps` `agents[].paneKey` to `terminal list` `tabId:leafId`, rather than title or preview or content — recurrence: 2 — candidate: yes
- **tracer-bullet-design-assumptions**: run each load-bearing design assumption as a throwaway shell/git command before writing it into the design — confirmed the `--porcelain` boundary and the base-ref chain, and found a truncation hole, all before any code existed — recurrence: 4 — candidate: yes
- **assert-literal-instruction-in-doc-tests**: anchor documentation tests on the literal instruction string; asserting that two component words appear "somewhere" passes with the guidance deleted — recurrence: 2 — candidate: maybe
