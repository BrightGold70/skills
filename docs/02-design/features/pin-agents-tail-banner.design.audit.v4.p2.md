## Summary
The design is exceptionally clean and correctly implements the spec and plan. Previous audit findings regarding `set -u` safety, stderr routing, and candidate pool consistency have been fully addressed, and invariant compliance is strictly maintained. Axis C reconciliation confirms no silent drift:
