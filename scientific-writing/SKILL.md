1. Study Design
2. Setting
3. Participants
4. Variables
5. Statistical Analysis

**Key principle:** Enough detail to reproduce

### Results

**Structure:**
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Primary outcome

## Writing Best Practices

### Clarity

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "The results demonstrated that" | "We found that" |
| "It is interesting to note" | Omit |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |

### Active vs Passive

**Use active for:**
- Methods (We performed...)
- Results (We observed...)

**Use passive for:**
- Established methods (Blood samples were collected...)
- When agent is unknown

### Numbers

| Style | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Spell out 1-9 | "seven patients" |
| Use numerals 10+ | "15 participants" |
| Start sentence | "Ten percent..." |
| Percent | "10%" (with numeral) |

### Abbreviations

**Rule:** Define on first use

**Example:**
```
First use: "International Normalized Ratio (INR)"
Subsequent: "INR"
```
