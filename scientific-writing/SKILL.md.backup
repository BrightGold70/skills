# Scientific Writing

A comprehensive skill for writing scientific manuscripts with precision, clarity, and human-like prose. Integrates academic workflows, medical writing standards, AI pattern removal, and diagram creation.

## Overview

This skill combines:
- **Academic workflows** (plan-outline, write, review, switch-venue, switch-language)
- **Medical AI writing standards** (clinical validation, ethics compliance)
- **Humanization** (remove 24 AI writing patterns)
- **Diagram integration** (draw.io for scientific figures)
- **IMRAD structure** (Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion)
- **Citation management** (APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE)
- **Reporting guidelines** (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, STARD, TRIPOD)

**Critical Principle: Always write in full paragraphs with flowing prose. Never submit bullet points in the final manuscript.**

---

## Core Workflow Modes

### 1. `plan-outline` (概要规划)

**Purpose**: Generate paper outline and content structure.

**Process**:
1. Identify one-sentence core contribution
2. Build IMRAD structure around central narrative
3. Plan figures and tables as the backbone
4. Determine target journal and reporting guidelines

**Output**: Structured outline with:
- Section breakdown
- Key points per section
- Planned figures/tables
- Citation placeholders

### 2. `write` (章节写作与整合)

**Purpose**: Draft sections with active delivery and consistency.

**Features**:
- **Two-stage process**: 
  - Stage 1: Create bullet-point outline
  - Stage 2: Convert to full flowing prose
- **Auto-adapt**: Adjust content depth for venue (e.g., NeurIPS 9 pages, ICML 8 pages)
- **Citation integration**: Natural incorporation of references
- **Field-specific terminology**: Match discipline conventions

**After Writing - Mandatory Humanization**:
```
After completing any draft, ALWAYS run humanization to remove AI patterns:
- Remove inflated significance language
- Fix superficial -ing phrases
- Replace vague attributions with specific sources
- Eliminate promotional/advertising tone
- Remove filler transitions
- Vary sentence structure naturally
```

### 3. `review` (多审稿人评审)

**Purpose**: Simulate multi-reviewer critique.

**Process**:
- Simulate 2-3 reviewers with different perspectives
- Check: Originality, methodology, statistics, clarity, ethics
- Generate structured review with actionable feedback
- Output: `review.md` with revision suggestions

### 4. `switch-venue` (渠道切换)

**Purpose**: Adapt manuscript for different journals/conferences.

**Adjustments**:
- Page limits and section structure
- Citation format (APA → AMA → Vancouver)
- Abstract style (structured vs. unstructured)
- Ethical statements requirements
- Figure/table specifications
- Broader Impact or Limitations sections

### 5. `switch-language` (语言切换)

**Purpose**: Toggle between English and Chinese writing.

**English Mode**:
- Concise, direct prose
- Avoid over-decoration
- Active voice preferred
- Simple constructions (is/are/has)

**Chinese Mode** (中文模式):
- Follow Chinese copywriting guidelines
- Proper spacing between Chinese and English
- Full-width punctuation
- Natural Chinese academic tone

## Writing Process: Two-Stage Method

### Stage 1: Create Section Outlines with Key Points

Create structured outline with bullet points:
- Main arguments or findings
- Key studies to cite
- Data points and statistics
- Logical flow markers

**Example outline (Introduction):**
```
- Background: AI in drug discovery gaining traction
  * Cite recent reviews (Smith 2023, Jones 2024)
  * Traditional methods slow and expensive
- Gap: Limited application to rare diseases
  * Only 2 prior studies (Lee 2022, Chen 2023)
- Our approach: Transfer learning
- Study objectives: Validate on 3 datasets
```

### Stage 2: Convert to Full Paragraphs

Transform bullets into flowing prose:
1. **Complete sentences** with subjects, verbs, objects
2. **Add transitions** (however, moreover, subsequently)
3. **Integrate citations** naturally within sentences
4. **Expand context** that bullets omit
5. **Ensure logical flow** within paragraphs
6. **Vary sentence structure** for engagement

**Example prose:**
```
Artificial intelligence approaches have gained significant traction in drug 
discovery pipelines over the past decade (Smith, 2023; Jones, 2024). While 
these computational methods show promise for accelerating therapeutic 
candidate identification, traditional experimental approaches remain slow 
and resource-intensive. However, AI application to rare diseases has been 
limited, with only two prior studies demonstrating proof-of-concept results 
(Lee, 2022; Chen, 2023). The primary obstacle has been the scarcity of 
training data for conditions affecting small patient populations.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Introduction (Outline → Prose)

**Outline:**
```
- Background: CML treatment with TKIs
  * Imatinib revolutionized treatment (Druker et al., 2001)
  * 2nd-gen TKIs improved responses but toxic
- Gap: Need better first-line options
  * T315I mutation resistant
- New approach: Asciminib (STAMP inhibitor)
- Study objectives: Compare asciminib vs standard TKIs
```

**Prose:**
```
The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the 
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with imatinib first demonstrating 
the potential for targeted therapy in this disease (Druker et al., 2001). 
Subsequent second-generation TKIs improved molecular response rates but introduced 
new challenges, including cardiovascular toxicity and intolerance in a subset 
of patients. Despite these advances, significant unmet needs remain, particularly 
for patients with the T315I gatekeeper mutation who are resistant to most 
available TKIs.

Asciminib represents a novel therapeutic approach as a first-in-class STAMP 
(Specifically Targeting the ABL Myristoyl Pocket) inhibitor. Unlike ATP-competitive 
TKIs, asciminib binds allosterically to the myristoyl pocket of the BCR-ABL1 
protein, a mechanism that not only circumvents resistance mutations in the 
ATP-binding site but also demonstrates activity against the T315I mutation. 
This distinct mechanism, combined with a favorable safety profile, positions 
asciminib as a promising candidate for first-line CML therapy.
```

### Example 2: Results (Bad vs. Good)

**Poor (AI-sounding with bullet points):**
```
The results were significant. Key findings include:
- MMR rate: 67.7% vs 49.0%
- p-value: <0.001
- Follow-up: 48 weeks
```

**Good (humanized prose):**
```
At 48 weeks, the major molecular response (MMR) rate was significantly higher 
in the asciminib group compared to the standard TKI group (67.7% vs. 49.0%; 
p < 0.001). This difference was consistent across predefined subgroups, 
including age, Sokal risk score, and baseline disease burden.
```
