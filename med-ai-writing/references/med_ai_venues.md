# Med-AI Venues Reference

This document summarizes mainstream submission venues for medical-AI interdisciplinary direction and their core preferences.

## 1. Top Medical Journals (Clinical Focus)

These journals have extremely high requirements for clinical value and validation rigor, technical details usually placed in appendix.

| Journal | Preference | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature Medicine** | Breakthrough clinical applications | Must have external validation, preferably prospective clinical trials. |
| **The Lancet Digital Health** | Digital health real-world impact | Emphasizes changes to medical workflow and large-scale population validation. |
| **JAMA Network Open** | Clinical epidemiology and AI | Focuses on AI applications in specific disease diagnosis/prognosis. |

## 2. Top AI/Engineering Journals (Technical Focus)

These journals balance technical innovation with medical applications.

| Journal | Preference | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IEEE TMI** | Medical image processing algorithms | Emphasizes mathematical rigor, physics model integration, and algorithmic innovation. |
| **Medical Image Analysis** | Deep learning and medical imaging | Focuses on deep computer vision applications in medical field. |
| **Nature Machine Intelligence** | Interdisciplinary AI research | Emphasizes generalizability of AI methodology and its unique contributions in medicine. |

## 3. Top Conferences (Fast-paced Innovation)

| Conference | Preference | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MICCAI** | Medical image computing and intervention | Submission March-April annually, emphasizes algorithm performance on specific medical tasks. |
| **ISBI** | Biomedical imaging | Focuses on imaging technology and signal processing. |
| **CHIL** | Machine learning and health | Focuses on machine learning in clinical decision support. |

## 4. Format Conversion Recommendations

-   **MICCAI → IEEE TMI**: Expand 8-page conference paper to 10-12 page journal paper. Add more ablation experiments, deeper mathematical derivation, and broader dataset validation.
-   **AI Conference → Clinical Journal**: Thoroughly rewrite Introduction and Discussion, shift focus from "algorithm SOTA" to "clinical pain point resolution". Move complex network structure diagrams to appendix, move clinical metrics (Sensitivity, Specificity) to main text.
-   **General Requirements**: Regardless of venue, must include **Ethics Statement** and **Data Availability Statement**.
