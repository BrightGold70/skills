# Med-AI Narrative Guide

The success of medical-AI interdisciplinary papers lies in balancing "technical innovation" with "clinical utility".

## 1. Core Narrative Framework (The Clinical-AI Loop)

Med-AI papers should follow this logical flow:

1.  **Clinical Background**: Describe disease burden (incidence, mortality) and current clinical practice.
2.  **Clinical Gap**: Clearly identify pain points in current diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis (e.g., high subjectivity, low efficiency, resource scarcity).
3.  **AI Solution**: Introduce how your AI method specifically addresses above pain points.
4.  **Technical Innovation**: Emphasize algorithmic novelty (e.g., robustness design for medical image noise, multi-modal fusion strategies).
5.  **Evidence of Efficacy**: Prove AI superiority through rigorous experiments (including comparison with clinical gold standards).
6.  **Clinical Impact**: Discuss how the technology would change medical practice if deployed clinically.

## 2. Cross-disciplinary Language Balance

-   **Abstract**: Must include clinical background and final clinical conclusion.
-   **Introduction**: Avoid excessive AI terminology, focus on "why this clinical problem needs AI".
-   **Methods**: 
    -   **Data**: Detailed description of data source, inclusion/exclusion criteria.
    -   **Model**: Use standard terminology and explain medical motivation behind model design.
-   **Discussion**: Must include **Clinical Implications** section, discussing model application potential in real medical environments.

## 3. Common Narrative Pitfalls

-   **Over-engineering**: Pursuing minor SOTA improvements while ignoring clinical significance.
-   **Ignoring Noise**: Medical data naturally has high noise and imbalance, narrative should reflect handling of these issues.
-   **Black Box Problem**: Medical community has high requirements for explainability, narrative should include saliency maps or feature analysis.
