# Hematology Paper Writer 🩸

Expert system for creating publication-ready hematology manuscripts with integrated web search, PubMed literature search, quality analysis, reference verification, multi-format document conversion, NotebookLM-powered research intelligence, nomenclature compliance (HGVS 2024, ISCN 2024), reporting guideline checklists (PRISMA 2020, CONSORT 2010, CARE 2013), and a Streamlit web interface.

## Core Principles

1. **Clinical Accuracy**: Ensure medical/scientific terminology is correct and current
2. **Journal Compliance**: Follow target journal's specific formatting and content requirements
3. **Reference Integrity**: Verify all citations against PubMed database (100% match required)
4. **Academic Rigor**: Maintain scholarly standards per hematology research conventions
5. **Research Integrity**: Ensure all claims are supported by verified peer-reviewed sources
6. **Reproducibility**: Document methods and analyses clearly for replication
7. **Web-Enhanced Research**: Leverage web search for real-time evidence gathering

## Working Directory Protocol & Timestamps ⏱️

Unless otherwise specified, all outputs, designs, and drafts MUST be managed within the user's dedicated Dropbox repository:
**`/Users/kimhawk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Paper/Hematology_paper_writer/[Project_Name]/`**

You (the AI) must proactively create this directory structure if it does not exist when starting a new project:
```
[Project_Name]/
├── docs/
│   ├── submissions/      # Final compiled DOCX/PDFs
│   ├── manuscripts/      # Design docs and brainstorming
│   └── drafts/           # Incremental section drafts
├── literature/           # PDFs and exported PMIDs
└── data/                 # Raw CSVs and analysis scripts
```

**CRITICAL TIMESTAMP RULE:** Every single file generated by this skill (designs, drafts, final submissions, data outputs, PMIDs lists) MUST be prefixed with the current timestamp in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format.
Example: `20260223_093045_aml_review_conclusion_draft.md`

## CRITICAL: Data Source Priority Rule

### **STEP 1: ALWAYS Query NotebookLM First**
When preparing data for manuscript writing, the system MUST:
1. **First**: Query NotebookLM MCP (notebooklm) for existing research data
2. **If NotebookLM has NO relevant data**: Then search PubMed as fallback
3. **NEVER skip NotebookLM query** - it contains curated research intelligence

### **STEP 2: Prose-Only Manuscript Writing**
- **NO bullet points** in the manuscript body - convert all to flowing prose
- Use complete paragraphs with proper academic transitions
- Each section should have substantial narrative explanation

### **STEP 3: Expanded Abstract**
- Abstract must be expanded to **NEARLY the maximum word limit** of the target journal:
  - Blood Research: ~250 words (target 240-250)
  - Blood: ~200 words (target 190-200)
  - Blood Advances: ~250 words (target 240-250)
  - JCO: ~250 words (target 240-250)
- Abstract should be fully expanded prose, not summarized

### **STEP 4: Detailed Explanations Throughout**
- Every section needs comprehensive, detailed explanations
- Don't just state facts - provide context, mechanisms, clinical significance
- Expand on molecular pathways, clinical implications, and mechanistic rationale
- Manuscripts must have "long context which is sufficient for explaining topics"

### **STEP 5: Reference Verification (MANDATORY)**
- ALL references MUST match PubMed records (100% match required)
- Verify each reference after manuscript creation
- Include PMID for each reference when available
- Fix any mismatches before final output

### **STEP 6: Citation Density (CRITICAL - PLAGIARISM PREVENTION)**
- **EVERY sentence that presents data, makes claims, or references specific findings MUST have a citation**
- A manuscript with ~6,500 words requires MINIMUM 25-35 references
- Multiple citations per sentence are acceptable when claiming multiple facts
- No uncited statements of fact allowed - this is plagiarism concern

### **STEP 7: Reference Diversity Requirements**
- Include diverse reference types:
  - Clinical trials (ASC4FIRST, pivotal studies)
  - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
  - Guidelines (ELN, NCCN)
  - Mechanistic/basic science studies
  - Real-world evidence studies
  - Safety and pharmacovigilance studies

### **STEP 8: NotebookLM-First Citation (MANDATORY)**
- **PRIORITY**: Cite NotebookLM sources FIRST before other references
- If NotebookLM has relevant data, cite that source as primary
- Use PubMed only when NotebookLM doesn't have the specific data
- This ensures citations come from verified research intelligence

### **STEP 9: Citation Verification Process (MANDATORY)**
After manuscript creation, verify EVERY citation:
1. **Source Verification**: Confirm the cited source contains the claimed data
2. **Data Match**: Verify statistics, percentages, and findings match exactly
3. **Context Check**: Ensure the citation supports the claim being made
4. **PMID Verification**: Confirm PubMed IDs are valid (for PubMed sources)

**Verification Template:**
```
Citation [X] Claim: "[quoted claim from manuscript]"
→ Source check: [Does source Y contain this data?]
→ Data match: [Exact match / Partial match / No match]
→ Context: [Appropriate / Misleading / Not supported]
→ Status: [VERIFIED / NEEDS CORRECTION]
```

## Part 1: Web Search Integration for Medical Writing

### Overview

The hematology paper writer integrates web search capabilities to:
- Find recent publications and preprints
- Access clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP)
- Gather guideline information (NCCN, ELN, ESMO)
- Retrieve regulatory updates (FDA, EMA)
- Collect real-world evidence and real-time data

### NotebookLM Integration (PRIMARY DATA SOURCE)

**IMPORTANT**: Before any PubMed search, MUST query NotebookLM first:

1. **NotebookLM MCP Authentication** (REQUIRED for every session):
   - Use `notebooklm_setup_auth` for initial Google authentication
   - Use `notebooklm_get_health` to verify authentication status
   - Authentication is session-based - re-authenticate if needed

2. **Query NotebookLM Research**:
   - Use `notebooklm_ask_question` to query existing research data
   - If NotebookLM has relevant data, USE IT as primary source
   - Extract key findings, trial data, and clinical evidence from NotebookLM

3. **Fallback to PubMed** (ONLY if NotebookLM has no data):
   - If NotebookLM query returns "no relevant information" or similar
   - Then proceed with PubMed search using PubMedSearcher
   - Document that NotebookLM was checked first

**Workflow:**
```
1. notebooklm_setup_auth (if not authenticated)
2. notebooklm_get_health (verify auth)
3. notebooklm_ask_question("What is the evidence for [topic]?")
4. IF response has relevant data → Use as primary source
5. ELSE → Proceed with PubMed search
```

### NotebookLM Query Templates

Use these templates for common manuscript queries:

**Trial Results Query:**
```
What are the key efficacy results from [trial name]? Include specific data: [response rate], [survival endpoints], [p-values].
```

**Safety Data Query:**
```
What are the safety and adverse event data from [study/trial]? Include: [specific AEs], discontinuation rates, serious events.
```

**Mechanism Query:**
```
What is the mechanism of action for [drug]? How does it differ from [comparator drugs]?
```

**Guideline Query:**
```
What are the current [ELN/NCCN] recommendations for [disease] treatment? Include specific criteria for [treatment decision].
```

**Epidemiology Query:**
```
What is the epidemiology of [disease]? Include incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and mortality data.
```

**Comparison Query:**
```
Compare [treatment A] vs [treatment B] for [disease]. Include efficacy, safety, and response rates.
```

### Web Search Sources

**Academic Databases:**
- **PubMed** (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - Primary medical literature
- **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com) - Broad academic search
- **IEEE Xplore** - Engineering/biomedical research
- **Cochrane Library** - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- **EMBASE** - European biomedical literature

**Clinical Registries:**
- **ClinicalTrials.gov** - Clinical trial results and status
- **ICTRP** (WHO) - International clinical trial registry
- **EudraCT** - European clinical trial registry

**Guidelines:**
- **NCCN Guidelines** - National Comprehensive Cancer Network
- **ELN Recommendations** - European LeukemiaNet
- **ESMO Guidelines** - European Society for Medical Oncology

**Regulatory:**
- **FDA** (fda.gov) - Drug approvals, safety alerts
- **EMA** (ema.europa.eu) - European Medicines Agency
- **PMDA** (pmda.go.jp) - Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan)

### Search Strategy Framework

**Step 1: Broad Discovery**
```
Search: "chronic myeloid leukemia treatment 2024"
Targets: PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov
```

**Step 2: Focused Retrieval**
```
Search: "asciminib versus imatinib ASC4FIRST trial results"
Targets: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov
```

**Step 3: Grey Literature**
```
Search: "asciminib FDA approval label indication"
Targets: FDA website, EMA, regulatory databases
```

**Step 4: Guideline Integration**
```
Search: "ELN 2025 CML treatment recommendations"
Targets: NCCN, ELN, ESMO websites
```

### Integrated Skill: literature-review

For systematic literature reviews requiring rigorous methodology, use the **`literature-review`** skill:

**When to invoke:**
- Systematic reviews with PRISMA compliance
- Meta-analyses requiring pooled effect estimates
- Scoping reviews withArksey & O'Malley framework
- Rapid reviews with accelerated timelines

**Skill invocation:**
```
Use the literature-review skill for:
- Structured review protocols (PICO, SPIDER)
- Search strategy development with Boolean operators
- Study selection and data extraction workflows
- Risk of bias assessment (ROB 2.0, ROBINS-I)
- Evidence synthesis and heterogeneity analysis
```

**Complementary use:** The literature-review skill enhances Part 1 by providing systematic review methodology for comprehensive literature searches.

## CRITICAL: Manuscript Writing Standards

### Prose-Only Requirement (MANDATORY)

When writing any manuscript section:
- ❌ **NEVER use bullet points** (`•`, `-`, `*`)
- ❌ **NEVER use numbered lists** for content
- ✅ **ALWAYS use flowing prose** with complete paragraphs
- ✅ **Use academic transitions** between ideas
- ✅ **Provide comprehensive explanations** - don't just list facts

**Example Conversion:**
```
BAD (bullet points):
• MMR at 48 weeks: 67.7% vs 49.0%
• MR4 at 48 weeks: 38.8% vs 20.6%
• Discontinuation: 4.5% vs 11.1%

GOOD (prose):
The major molecular response rate at 48 weeks was significantly higher in the asciminib group compared to standard therapy, with 67.7% of patients achieving MMR versus 49.0% in the control arm [1]. This represents an absolute difference of 18.9 percentage points. Furthermore, deep molecular responses were substantially more common with asciminib, as MR4 was achieved by 38.8% of patients receiving asciminib compared to only 20.6% of those on standard tyrosine kinase inhibitors [1]. The clinical significance of these deeper responses is particularly relevant for patients who may be candidates for treatment-free remission, as sustained MR4 or better for at least two years is considered a prerequisite for attempting therapy discontinuation [2]. Notably, the rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was substantially lower with asciminib at 4.5% compared to 11.1% in the imatinib group, suggesting improved tolerability that may facilitate long-term treatment adherence [1].
```

### Citation Density Rule (MANDATORY - PLAGIARISM PREVENTION)

**THIS IS CRITICAL**: Every sentence that presents data, makes claims, or references specific findings MUST have a citation.

**Citation Requirements:**
- Minimum 25-35 references for a systematic review (~5,000-7,000 words)
- Every factual statement needs a citation
- Multiple citations per sentence are acceptable
- Claims without citations = PLAGIARISM concern

**Citation Placement Examples:**
```
BAD (no citation - plagiarism):
Chronic myeloid leukemia is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the
Philadelphia chromosome.

GOOD (with citation):
Chronic myeloid leukemia is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the
Philadelphia chromosome, which results from the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation
that creates the BCR::ABL1 fusion oncogene [1].

BAD (multiple claims, single citation):
Imatinib revolutionized CML treatment and has high response rates.

GOOD (multiple claims, multiple citations):
Imatinib revolutionized CML treatment by targeting the BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase,
becoming the standard of care since its introduction in 2001 [2]. Subsequent
generations of TKIs have demonstrated higher response rates compared with
imatinib in randomized trials [3][4].
```

**Reference Diversity Target:**
| Type | Target Count | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Clinical trials | 8-12 | Primary efficacy/safety data |
| Systematic reviews | 3-5 | Evidence synthesis |
| Guidelines | 2-3 | Clinical practice standards |
| Mechanistic studies | 3-5 | Biological rationale |
| Real-world evidence | 2-3 | Generalizability |
| Safety/pharmacovigilance | 2-3 | Adverse event data |

### Abstract Expansion (MANDATORY)

The abstract is the most critical part - it must be fully expanded:
- Target **95-100% of journal's word limit**
- Include comprehensive background, methods, results, conclusions
- Every sentence should convey substantial information
- Avoid redundancy - each word should add value

**Blood Research Abstract Structure (~250 words):**
```
Background: [2-3 sentences on disease burden and treatment evolution]
Objective: [1 sentence on systematic review purpose]
Methods: [2-3 sentences on search strategy, inclusion criteria, endpoints]
Results: [4-5 sentences on key findings with specific data]
Conclusions: [2-3 sentences on clinical implications]
```

### Detailed Explanations Throughout

Every manuscript section must include:
1. **Mechanistic explanations** - How and why things work
2. **Clinical significance** - Why it matters for patients
3. **Contextual background** - Historical and current perspectives
4. **Limitations and strengths** - Critical appraisal
5. **Future directions** - Research gaps and opportunities

**Section Expansion Guidelines:**
- Introduction: 3-4 substantial paragraphs per subsection
- Methods: 2-3 paragraphs explaining each procedure
- Results: Narrative descriptions, not just data presentation
- Discussion: 3-4 paragraphs per major finding
- Conclusion: 1-2 paragraphs synthesizing key points

## Part 3: Reference Formats

### Vancouver (Numbered Format) - WITH PMID REQUIRED

**CRITICAL**: Every reference MUST include PMID for verification.

**Citation Method for Plagiarism Prevention:**

Every sentence that contains factual information, data, or claims MUST have a citation. This includes:

1. **Statistical data**: Any numbers, percentages, rates must cite source
   ```
   The MMR rate at 48 weeks was 67.7% in the asciminib arm [1].
   ```

2. **Study mentions**: Any named trial/study must have citation
   ```
   The ASC4FIRST trial demonstrated superior efficacy [1].
   ```

3. **Guideline statements**: Clinical recommendations need citation
   ```
   ELN recommendations endorse TKI discontinuation in eligible patients [15].
   ```

4. **Mechanistic facts**: Biological mechanisms need citation
   ```
   Asciminib binds to the myristate pocket, inducing conformational change [7].
   ```

5. **Historical facts**: Treatment evolution needs citation
   ```
   Imatinib became standard first-line therapy in 2001 [2].
   ```

**Common Citation Patterns:**

| Situation | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Single fact | [1] | "MMR was achieved by 67.7% [1]." |
| Multiple facts | [1][2] | "Higher than imatinib (49.0%) [1] and dasatinib [2]." |
| Multiple studies | [1-3] | "Confirmed by multiple trials [1-3]." |
| Supporting + contrasting | [1][4] | "Efficacy shown [1] but safety concerns remain [4]." |

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Make claims without citations
- ❌ State facts without attribution
- ❌ Describe study results without citation
- ❌ Mention guidelines without citation

**DO:**
- ✅ Cite every factual statement
- ✅ Use multiple citations when claiming multiple facts
- ✅ Cite primary sources for data (clinical trials, not reviews only)
- ✅ Include PMID for verification

**Journal Article:**
```
[1] Author AB, Author CD, Author EF. Title of article. Journal Name. Year;Volume(Issue):Pages. doi:xxx. PMID: 12345678
```

**Journal Article with Multiple Authors (>6):**
```
[2] Author A, Author B, Author C, et al. Title of article. Journal Name. Year;Volume:Pages. doi:xxx. PMID: 12345678
```

**Reference Verification Rule:**
- ❌ **NEVER** finalize manuscript without PubMed verification
- ✅ **ALWAYS** include PMID in reference
- ✅ Verify 100% match with PubMed record
- ✅ Fix any discrepancies before output

### Key Vancouver Rules

- Number references consecutively in order of appearance
- Use square brackets [1], [2], [3]
- List all authors up to 6; use "et al." if >6
- Use initials for first/middle names
- Abbreviate journal names per NLM standards
- Include DOI when available
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout

---

### Integrated Skill: citation-management

For multi-format citation handling and advanced reference management, use the **`citation-management`** skill:

**When to invoke:**
- Converting between citation styles (APA, AMA, Chicago, Harvard)
- Managing large reference libraries
- Formatting complex citations (conference proceedings, preprints, patents)
- Generating formatted bibliographies

**Skill invocation:**
```
Use the citation-management skill for:
- Vancouver format expansion (APA 7th, AMA, Chicago, Harvard)
- Reference library organization and deduplication
- Citation style conversion for journal requirements
- In-text citation formatting (author-date vs. numbered)
- Bibliography generation with multiple output formats
```

**Complementary use:** The citation-management skill enhances Part 3 by providing additional citation format options beyond Vancouver for journals requiring different styles.

## Part 3A: Citation Verification Protocol

### Overview

Citation verification ensures that every claim in the manuscript is supported by the cited source. This prevents academic misconduct and ensures scientific integrity.

### Verification Workflow

**STEP 1: Authentication**
```
1. notebooklm_setup_auth (if not authenticated)
2. notebooklm_get_health (verify auth)
```

**STEP 2: Source Query**
```
For each citation [X]:
1. Query NotebookLM: "What does [source] say about [claim]?"
2. If NotebookLM has data → Verify claim matches
3. If NotebookLM lacks data → Query PubMed

## Part 10: Farquhar 5-Sentence Abstract Method

### The Narrative Principle
A hematology paper is not a collection of data, but a coherent clinical story backed by evidence.
- **One-sentence contribution**: Must summarize your core finding in one sentence
- **Three Pillars**:
  - **What**: Your novel clinical or scientific finding
  - **Why**: Evidence supporting the finding (trial data, mechanistic insights)
  - **So What**: Why clinicians/researchers should care (clinical implications)

### 5-Sentence Abstract Structure (Farquhar's Method)

For hematology manuscripts, apply this structure:

1. **Achievement** (Context + Main Finding)
   - "We report [main outcome] in [patient population] with [disease]"
   - Example: "We report the 5-year outcomes of first-line asciminib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia"

2. **Difficulty/Importance** (Clinical Challenge)
   - Why this problem matters and why it's challenging
   - Example: "Despite advances in tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a significant proportion of patients develop intolerance or resistance"

3. **Method** (Study Design + Key Intervention)
   - How you solved it (include study type, patient numbers, key methods)
   - Example: "In this multicenter, phase 3 trial, 400 patients were randomized to receive asciminib versus standard-of-care TKIs"

4. **Evidence** (Key Results with Data)
   - Your experimental/clinical support with specific numbers
   - Example: "At median follow-up of 58 months, major molecular response rates were 78% with asciminib versus 62% with standard TKIs (P<0.001)"

5. **Conclusion** (Most Significant Impact)
   - The most important clinical or scientific takeaway
   - Example: "These results establish asciminib as a new standard-of-care for frontline CML treatment"

### Hematology-Specific Tips

- **Include specific endpoints**: Mention MR4.5, PFS, OS, ORR with actual percentages
- **Cite pivotal trials**: Reference registration numbers (e.g., ASC4FIRST, NCT02081378)
- **State significance**: Connect findings to clinical practice guidelines (ELN, NCCN)

## Part 12: Plan-Outline Enhanced Workflow

### Two-Stage Planning Method

Based on scientific-writing best practices, use this two-stage approach:

### Stage 1: Conceptual Outline

**Purpose**: Define the paper's core contribution and narrative structure

**Output**: 1-page outline with:
1. **One-sentence core contribution**: The single most important finding
2. **Story arc**: How the paper builds to that finding
3. **Key data points**: 3-5 critical numbers/results that support the conclusion
4. **Target venue**: Journal selection with word limit

**Template:**
```
Core Contribution: [One sentence describing the main finding]

Story Arc:
- Opening: [What clinical/problem gap motivates this study]
- Build: [What preliminary data or context supports the study]
- Peak: [What is the main result]
- Resolution: [What does this mean for clinical practice]

Key Data Points:
1. [Primary endpoint result]
2. [Secondary endpoint result]  
3. [Safety/safety profile result]

Target Venue: [Journal name] - [Word limit]
```

### Stage 2: Detailed IMRAD Structure

**Purpose**: Convert conceptual outline into detailed manuscript sections

**Output**: Detailed section-by-section outline with:
- Introduction: Problem statement, gap identification, study objective
- Methods: Study design, patient population, endpoints, statistical methods
- Results: Organized by endpoint (primary first), include all relevant subgroups
- Discussion: Interpret results, compare with literature, clinical implications, limitations

### Workflow Commands

```bash
# Stage 1: Create conceptual outline
hpw plan-outline "novel therapy for CML" --type clinical_trial --core-finding "asciminib shows superior MRR"

# Stage 2: Generate detailed structure
hpw create-outline draft_concept.md --expand-imrad --target-journal blood

# Full workflow: Plan to draft

## Part 13: Prose Polish & Humanization

### Overview

AI-generated scientific writing often exhibits detectable patterns that reduce credibility and readability. This section provides tools to polish manuscripts and remove common AI writing artifacts while maintaining academic rigor.

### Core Principle

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases." — Wikipedia AI Writing Project

### 24 AI Writing Patterns to Remove

#### Content Patterns

| # | Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | **Significance inflation** | "marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of..." | State actual significance without hyperbole |
| 2 | **Notability name-dropping** | "cited in NYT, BBC, FT, and The Hindu" | Cite specific sources when relevant |
| 3 | **Superficial -ing analyses** | "symbolizing... reflecting... showcasing..." | Remove or expand with specific evidence |
| 4 | **Promotional language** | "nestled within the breathtaking region" | Use neutral, descriptive language |
| 5 | **Vague attributions** | "Experts believe it plays a crucial role" | Cite specific studies or data |
| 6 | **Formulaic challenges** | "Despite challenges... continues to thrive" | State specific challenges with evidence |

#### Language Patterns

| # | Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|
| 7 | **AI vocabulary** | "Additionally... testament... landscape... showcasing" | Use simpler alternatives: "also... remain common" |
| 8 | **Copula avoidance** | "serves as... features... boasts" | Use direct forms: "is... has" |
| 9 | **Negative parallelisms** | "It's not just X, it's Y" | State the point directly |
| 10 | **Rule of three overuse** | "innovation, inspiration, and insights" | Use natural number of items |
| 11 | **Synonym cycling** | "protagonist... main character... central figure" | Repeat the clearest term |
| 12 | **False ranges** | "from the Big Bang to dark matter" | List topics directly |

#### Style Patterns

| # | Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|
| 13 | **Em dash overuse** | "institutions—not the people—yet" | Use commas or periods |
| 14 | **Boldface overuse** | "**Performance:** Performance improved" | Convert to prose |
| 15 | **Inline-header lists** | "**Performance:** Performance improved" | Write as flowing paragraphs |
| 16 | **Title Case Headings** | "Strategic Negotiations And Partnerships" | Use sentence case |
| 17 | **Emojis** | "🚀 Key Insight:" | Remove entirely |
| 18 | **Curly quotes** | `said "the project"` | Use straight quotes |

#### Communication Patterns

| # | Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|
| 19 | **Chatbot artifacts** | "I hope this helps! Let me know if..." | Remove entirely |
| 20 | **Cutoff disclaimers** | "While details are limited..." | Find sources or remove |
| 21 | **Sycophantic tone** | "Great question! You're absolutely right!" | Respond directly |

#### Filler and Hedging

| # | Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|
| 22 | **Filler phrases** | "In order to", "Due to the fact that" | Use "To", "Because" |
| 23 | **Excessive hedging** | "could potentially possibly" | Use single "may" |
| 24 | **Generic conclusions** | "The future looks bright" | State specific plans or facts |

### Hematology-Specific Examples

**Before (AI-sounding):**

## Part 14: Style Register Options

### Overview

Different contexts require different writing styles. This section provides guidance for adapting the manuscript voice to match the target audience and purpose.

### Available Style Registers

#### 1. Formal Academic (Default for Journals)

**Characteristics:**
- Passive voice acceptable for methods
- Complex sentences permitted
- Third-person preferred
- Minimal emotional language
- Full technical terminology

**Example:**
> The efficacy of the intervention was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (N=250). Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in the primary endpoint (p<0.001).

#### 2. Clinical Narrative (Case Discussions)

**Characteristics:**
- First-person acceptable for observations
- More conversational tone
- Clinical reasoning emphasized
- Patient-centered language
- Real-world applicability highlighted

**Example:**
> We observed a notable response in a 45-year-old patient with refractory disease. After three cycles, the patient achieved a partial response, which we attributed to the aggressive salvage regimen.

#### 3. Journalistic (Reviews, Press Releases)

**Characteristics:**
- Short paragraphs
- Impact-focused opening
- Minimal jargon
- Quotable statistics
- Broader context provided

**Example:**
> A new treatment approach shows promise for patients with advanced disease. In a study of 250 patients, nearly half responded to the therapy.

## Part 18: Reader Testing for Manuscripts

### Overview

Adapted from anthropics/doc-coauthoring reader-testing phase. Test the manuscript with a fresh perspective to catch gaps before submission.

## When to Use

- After completing first draft
- Before submission to journal
- After major revisions
- When collaborators have conflicting feedback

## Testing Process

### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions

Generate 5-10 questions reviewers or readers might ask:

1. "Why was this specific population chosen?"
2. "How does this compare to previous studies?"
3. "What are the main limitations?"
4. "What is the clinical relevance?"
5. "How would this change clinical practice?"

### Step 2: Self-Testing

Answer each question by reading your manuscript:
- Can you find the answer easily?
- Is the answer clearly stated?
- Are there any contradictions?

### Step 3: Fresh Reader Testing

If available, have a colleague read and ask them:
- What was unclear?
- What questions did they have?
- What seemed redundant?
- What needed more explanation?

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

Document gaps found:
| Question | Found in Section | Answer Clarity |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Why this population? | Methods | Clear |
| Comparison to prior work | Discussion | Missing |
| Limitations | Discussion | Brief |

### Step 5: Revision Planning

Create revision tasks:
1. Add comparison to [Study X] in Discussion
2. Expand limitations section
3. Clarify [specific point]

## Journal-Specific Testing

Different journals have different reviewers:

| Journal Type | Focus Areas |
|--------------|-------------|
| Clinical journals | Clinical implications, practical applications |
| Basic science | Mechanism, novelty, rigorous methods |
| Review articles | Comprehensiveness, synthesis |
| Case reports | Educational value, rarity |

## Part 19: Goal-Oriented Workflow Recipes

### Overview
This section outlines how to combine external skills sequentially to achieve specific manuscript types in Hematology.

### Recipe 1: The AI-Assisted Meta-Analysis
**Focus:** Systematic identification of literature, quantitative pooling, and structured manuscript drafting.
1. **Literature Discovery (`pubmed-integration` + `literature-review`)**: Execute PICO searches and export PMIDs for RCTs.
2. **Quantitative Synthesis (`statistical-analysis`)**: Provide data to calculate I², perform fixed/random-effects, and prepare Forest Plot inputs.
3. **Manuscript Generation (HPW)**: Use Systematic Review Drafter (PRISMA template). Ensure prose-only results explicitly cite pooled data.
4. **Verification & Formatting (`citation-management`)**: Auto-format bibliography to target journal style.

### Recipe 2: The Clinical Trial / Cohort Report
**Focus:** Transforming raw clinical/observational data into a CONSORT-compliant manuscript.
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`statistical-analysis`)**: Read dataset, run assumption checks, and calculate primary endpoints (Log-rank, T-tests, Cox regression).
2. **Trial Manuscript Drafting (HPW)**: Pass verified statistics to Clinical Trial Drafter adhering to CONSORT guidelines.
3. **Baseline Consistency Check (`notebooklm` / `pubmed-integration`)**: Query latest standards (e.g., ELN) to ensure survival statistics align with or are contextualized against benchmarks.

### Recipe 3: The Comprehensive Narrative Review
**Focus:** Synthesizing large volumes of recent literature into a high-depth, submission-quality narrative driven review.
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** You must NEVER attempt to draft the entire manuscript in a single pass or rely exclusively on abstracts. A submission-quality review requires exact p-values, mechanistic context, and highly specific evidence synthesis without generalized fluff.

1. **The Deep Dive Search (`pubmed-database` / `pubmed-integration`)**: Query past 5 years of review articles/landmark studies on target topic.
2. **Mandatory Full-Text Integration (`notebooklm-assistant`)**: You MUST halt standard generation and strictly instruct the user to upload the full-text PDFs of the pivotal literature discovered in Step 1 into a specific NotebookLM notebook. *Do not proceed to drafting without deep context initialization.*
3. **Argument Structuring (`scientific-writing` + HPW)**: Build a structured outline mapping Farquhar methodology (Landscape, Gap, Innovations, Future) to standard academic headers (e.g., Introduction, Mechanisms of Action, Clinical Evidence Review, Discussion).
4. **Section-by-Section Sequencing (HPW + `notebooklm-assistant`)**: Draft exactly ONE section at a time. Query NotebookLM for deep, specific context bridging the current section's topic. Draft the section, ensure citations are aggressively placed, and wait for user approval before moving to the next section.
5. **The Prose Polish (HPW)**: Execute HPW's AI Pattern Removal guidelines across the unified manuscript.

---

## Workflow Integration Summary

This HPW skill is organized in three phases:

### Phase 1: Planning (Parts 1-8)
- Web search, reference formatting, verification, quality checks

### Phase 2: Writing (Parts 9-12)  
- Review simulation, abstract methods, venue selection, planning

### Phase 3: Refinement (Parts 13-18)
- Prose polish, style registers, NotebookLM, brainstorming, testing

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Start with **Part 16** (Brainstorming) for new manuscripts
2. Use **Part 17** (Writing Plans) for section development
3. Apply **Part 13** (Prose Polish) before final review
4. Complete with **Part 18** (Reader Testing) before submission
