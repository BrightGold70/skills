# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

### Purpose & Tone
- What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial

### Key Differentiator
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?
- What's the one thing someone will remember?

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose distinctive, beautiful fonts
- Avoid: Arial, Inter, Roboto (generic)
- Pair distinctive display font with refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Focus on high-impact moments
- Staggered reveals on page load
- Scroll-triggering and hover states

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Custom cursors, grain overlays

## What to Avoid

❌ Generic AI aesthetics:
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking character

## Implementation

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Match complexity to vision (maximalist = elaborate, minimalist = precise)

## Tech Stack Options

- HTML/CSS/JS
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Vue
- Any modern frontend framework
