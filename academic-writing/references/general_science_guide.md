# General Science Journal Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Broad Impact
Nature/Science and similar journals require research with cross-disciplinary appeal.
- **Background**: Abstract and introduction should start from broader scientific context.
- **Storytelling**: Emphasize scientific significance of discovery, not just technical metrics.

### 2. Visual Storytelling
- **Figure 1**: Must be the soul of the paper. Should contain core mechanism diagram or most striking result.
- **Self-contained captions**: Readers should understand core findings through figures and captions even without reading main text.

## Figure and Table Standards

### Matplotlib Figures
- **Language**: Labels must be in English.
- **Font**: Recommend `serif` fonts (e.g., Times New Roman) to match LaTeX.
- **Resolution**: Export as PDF or 300+ DPI PNG.

### Tables (Three-line Table)
- Use `booktabs` package.
- Only three horizontal lines (Toprule, Midrule, Bottomrule).
- Strictly prohibited from using vertical dividers.

## Writing Recommendations
- **Discussion**: Deeply explore mechanistic significance of findings, not just repeat results.
- **Methods**: Nature style typically places detailed methods after main text or in supplementary materials.
