# CS/ML Paper Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy

### 1. The Narrative Principle
A paper is not a pile of experiments, but a rigorous, evidence-backed technical story.
- **One-sentence contribution**: Must be able to summarize your core contribution in one sentence.
- **Three Pillars**:
  - **What**: Your novel claim.
  - **Why**: Empirical evidence supporting the claim.
  - **So What**: Why readers should care.

### 2. Five-Sentence Abstract (Farquhar's Method)
1. **Achievement**: "We introduce...", "We prove..." (get straight to the point)
2. **Difficulty/Importance**: Why this problem is worth studying and challenging.
3. **Method**: How you solved it (include keywords).
4. **Evidence**: Your experimental support.
5. **Conclusion**: The most significant data or results.

## Section Requirements

- **Introduction**: Within 1.5 pages. Must enter Methods by pages 2-3.
- **Related Work**: Organize by methodology, not by paper list.
- **Experiments**: Before each experiment, declare: "This experiment aims to test [claim]..."
- **Limitations**: Honestly face limitations, this usually increases reviewer favorability.

## Writing Style (Micro-tips)
- **Reduce pronouns**: Avoid "This shows...", use "This result shows..."
- **Verbs first**: Place verbs near the beginning of sentences.
- **Eliminate hedging**: Unless truly uncertain, delete "may" and "can".
- **Remove filler words**: "actually", "very", "basically", etc.
