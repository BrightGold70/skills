# PDCA Gap Analysis: Hematology Clinical Analysis Skill Upgrade

## 1. Requirement Fulfillment

| Requirement | Status | Verification |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Hematology Specialization | 100% | Added metadata, endpoints, and reference guides. |
| Advanced Survival Metrics | 100% | Integrated `cmprsk` and `mstate` categories. |
| Cross-Skill Synergy | 100% | Detailed integration with `statistical-analysis` and `clinicaltrials-database`. |
| Example R Scripts | 100% | Created `example_hematology_survival.R`. |
| Documentation Structure | 100% | Implemented bkit `docs/` MD041-compliant structure. |

## 2. Quantitative Assessment

- **Feature Completion**: 5/5 features implemented.
- **Gap Analysis Score**: 100%
- **Iteration Required**: No (Gap >= 90%)

## 3. Analysis Findings

The skill is now significantly more robust for Hematology research. The inclusion of the `survminer` and `cmprsk` workflows directly addresses the user's need for prospective/retrospective analysis. Synergy with `statistical-analysis` ensures robust pre-processing (assumption checks).
