# Hematology Response Criteria Reference

This document summarizes the standard response criteria used in Hematological clinical trials for evaluating efficacy and progression.

## 1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) - ELN 2022 Criteria

| Category | Definition (ELN 2022) |
|----------|------------|
| **CR (Complete Remission)** | BM blasts < 5%; no peripheral blasts or Auer rods; no extramedullary disease; ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L; Plt ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L. |
| **CRh (CR with partial hematologic recovery)** | All CR criteria met except for counts: ANC ≥ 0.5 x 10⁹/L and Plt ≥ 50 x 10⁹/L. |
| **CRi (CR with incomplete recovery)** | All CR criteria met except for residual neutropenia (< 1.0 x 10⁹/L) or thrombocytopenia (< 100 x 10⁹/L). |
| **MLFS (Morphologic Leukemia-Free State)** | Bone marrow blasts < 5%; no blasts/Auer rods; no extramedullary disease. No count recovery required. |
| **PR (Partial Remission)** | BM blasts 5–25% and decrease of pretreatment percentage by at least 50%. |
| **cCR (Composite CR)** | Combined endpoint of CR + CRh + CRi. |
| **MRD- (MRD Negativity)** | No detectable leukemia cells by flow cytometry (< 10⁻³) or NGS. |

## 2. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) - Comprehensive Response Criteria

### 2.1 Hematologic Response

| Response Level | Criteria |
|----------------|----------|
| **CHR (Complete Hematologic Response)** | All of the following: WBC < 10 × 10⁹/L; differential without immature granulocytes and with < 5% basophils; platelet count < 450 × 10⁹/L; spleen non-palpable. |
| **Partial Hematologic Response** | Incomplete resolution of peripheral blood counts or splenomegaly, but clear improvement from baseline. |

### 2.2 Cytogenetic Response

Based on the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) metaphases in bone marrow (≥20 metaphases analyzed):

| Response Level | Ph+ Metaphases | Percentage |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **CCyR (Complete Cytogenetic Response)** | 0 Ph+ metaphases | 0% |
| **PCyR (Partial Cytogenetic Response)** | 1–35 Ph+ metaphases | 1–35% |
| **MCyR (Major Cytogenetic Response)** | Combined CCyR + PCyR | 0–35% |
| **Minor Cytogenetic Response** | 36–65 Ph+ metaphases | 36–65% |
| **Minimal Cytogenetic Response** | 66–95 Ph+ metaphases | 66–95% |
| **No Cytogenetic Response** | 96–100 Ph+ metaphases | 96–100% |

> **Note:** CCyR is the target response for chronic phase CML. PCyR provides significant prognostic value but is not considered adequate for optimal response.

### 2.3 Molecular Response

Based on BCR::ABL1 transcript levels measured by quantitative RT-PCR (International Scale, IS):

| Response Level | BCR::ABL1ᴵˢ | Log Reduction | Clinical Significance |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **MR¹** | ≤ 10% | 1-log | Early molecular response; indicates initial treatment effect |
| **MR²** | ≤ 1% | 2-log | Partial molecular response; correlates with partial cytogenetic response |
| **MR³ / MMR (Major Molecular Response)** | ≤ 0.1% | 3-log | Standard treatment milestone; associated with excellent long-term outcomes |
| **MR⁴ (Deep Molecular Response)** | ≤ 0.01% | 4-log | Required for TFR consideration; indicates deep suppression |
| **MR⁴·⁵ (Deep Molecular Response)** | ≤ 0.0032% | 4.5-log | Enhanced eligibility for TFR; indicates very deep suppression |
| **MR⁵** | ≤ 0.001% | 5-log | Near-complete molecular eradication |
| **MR⁵S (MR5 Sustained)** | MR⁵ sustained for ≥ 2 years | 5-log | Deep sustained response for TFR |
| **MUL (Molecularly Undetectable Leukemia)** | Undetectable BCR::ABL1 by digital PCR (sensitivity ≥ 10⁻⁶) | ≥ 6-log | Deepest possible measurable response; undetectable by ultra-sensitive dPCR; replaces deprecated CMR terminology |
| **DMR (Deep Molecular Response)** | MR⁴ or deeper (MR⁴·⁵, MR⁵, MUL) | ≥ 4-log | Collective term for responses qualifying for TFR |

> **Technical Note:** 
> - MR¹–MR³: Standard qRT-PCR sufficient
> - MR⁴ requires ≥ 10⁴ cells analyzed (A⁴ ≥ 10,000)
> - MR⁴·⁵ requires ≥ 4.5 × 10⁴ cells analyzed (A⁴·⁵ ≥ 45,000)
> - MR⁵ requires ≥ 10⁵ cells analyzed (A⁵ ≥ 100,000)
> - MUL: Digital PCR (dPCR) undetectable with ≥ 10⁶ cells sensitivity; defines the deepest achievable response
> - **CMR (Complete Molecular Response)**: Deprecated term. Previously referred to undetectable disease by standard qRT-PCR (sensitivity ~10⁻⁵). Now superseded by MUL terminology which uses more sensitive digital PCR (dPCR) technology with 10⁻⁶ sensitivity

### 2.4 Treatment-Free Remission (TFR) Eligibility

Criteria for attempting treatment discontinuation (consensus guidelines):

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Molecular Response** | Sustained DMR (MR⁴ or deeper) for ≥ 2 years |
| **Duration of TKI Therapy** | ≥ 5 years of continuous TKI treatment |
| **Sustained MMR** | Documented MMR for ≥ 2 years before attempting TFR |

| **Prior Resistance** | No history of resistance to prior TKI therapy |
| **BCR::ABL1 Transcript Type** | e13a2 (b2a2) or e14a2 (b3a2) only (atypical transcripts require specialized monitoring) |

### 2.5 Response Milestone Timelines (ELN 2025)

| Time Point | Favorable (Optimal) | Warning | Unfavorable (Failure) |
|------------|--------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| **Baseline** | — | — | — |
| **3 Months** | BCR::ABL1 ≤ 10% | BCR::ABL1 > 10% | Confirmed BCR::ABL1 > 10% |
| **6 Months** | BCR::ABL1 ≤ 1% (CCyR equivalent) | BCR::ABL1 > 1%–10% | BCR::ABL1 > 10% |
| **12 Months** | BCR::ABL1 ≤ 0.1% (MMR) | BCR::ABL1 > 0.1%–1% | BCR::ABL1 > 1% |
| **Anytime** | BCR::ABL1 ≤ 0.1% | Loss of MMR | Loss of CHR, CCyR, or confirmed loss of MMR |

> **ELN 2025 Terminology Note:** The 2025 guidelines shifted from "Optimal/Warning/Failure" to "Favorable/Warning/Unfavorable" to reduce therapeutic nihilism associated with "failure" terminology.

### 2.6 Treatment Resistance Definitions

#### Primary Resistance (Intrinsic)

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hematologic Resistance** | Failure to achieve CHR by 3 months |
| **Cytogenetic Resistance** | Failure to achieve MCyR by 6 months or CCyR by 12 months |
| **Molecular Resistance** | Failure to achieve MMR by 12–18 months |

#### Secondary Resistance (Acquired)

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Loss of CHR** | Reappearance of immature cells, leukocytosis, or splenomegaly |
| **Loss of CCyR** | Reappearance of Ph+ metaphases (≥ 1%) after CCyR achieved |
| **Loss of MMR** | Confirmed BCR::ABL1 > 0.1% after MMR achieved |
| **Confirmed Loss of Response** | Two consecutive tests showing loss of response (1–3 months apart) |

### 2.7 BCR::ABL1 Transcript Types

| Transcript Type | Alternative Name | Frequency | Clinical Relevance |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **e13a2** | b2a2 | ~40% | Standard monitoring; TFR eligible |
| **e14a2** | b3a2 | ~55% | Standard monitoring; TFR eligible |
| **e19a2** | p230 | < 1% | Associated with neutrophilic CML; requires conversion factor |
| **e1a2** | p190 | < 1% | More common in Ph+ ALL; requires separate IS calibration |
| **Atypical transcripts** | Various | < 1% | May require specialized monitoring; often excluded from TFR trials |

> **Monitoring Note:** The International Scale (IS) was calibrated for e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts. Atypical transcripts require laboratory-specific validation.

### 2.8 Additional Chromosomal Abnormalities (ACA) in Ph+ Cells

| Category | Abnormalities | Prognostic Impact |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **High-Risk ACA** | +8, +Ph, i(17q), -7/7q, 3q26.2 rearrangements | Associated with accelerated phase; poor prognosis |
| **Low-Risk ACA** | -Y, +8 (as sole abnormality) | May not impact survival significantly |
| **Route to CCyR** | ACAs typically disappear with TKI therapy if CCyR achieved |

### 2.9 Accelerated Phase (AP) Definition (ELN 2025)

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Blasts in blood or marrow | 15–29% |
| Basophils in blood | ≥ 20% |
| Platelet count | < 100 × 10⁹/L (unrelated to therapy) |
| Platelet count | > 1000 × 10⁹/L (unresponsive to therapy) |
| Clonal evolution | High-risk ACA in Ph+ cells at diagnosis |
| Splenomegaly | Progressive, unresponsive to therapy |

> **2025 Update:** Threshold for blasts changed from 15–30% to 15–29% (30% now defines blast phase). High-risk ACAs at diagnosis now define AP regardless of other features.

## Analysis Note

When analyzing trial data, ensure the `rmcp` functions (e.g., `logistic_regression`) are used to model these categorical outcomes versus baseline risk factors (e.g., Cytogenetics, Age).
